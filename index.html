        <h3>ALU Software Engineering Department</h3>
        <img src="ru-campus.jpg" alt="ALU campus">
        <p>Department of Vawulence is a group of hilarious Software engineering students who love to joke around and
          share memes. We're always cracking jokes about programming languages, debugging, and even binary code. And
          don't get us started on our memes - we've got a whole library of them, and we're always on the lookout for the
          next big thing.

          Now, you might think that all this goofing around would get in the way of our studies, but you'd be wrong. We
          are some of the brightest students around *or not*, and we take our studies seriously(will edit this). We just
          happen to have a great sense of humor.</p>

        <h2>CSS specificity</h2>
        <p>CSS specificity is a measure of how specific a CSS selector is in targeting a specific element in an HTML
          document. When multiple styles are defined for the same element, it determines which styles should be applied
          to it.

          Selectors in CSS are ranked according to their specificity, with higher specificity selectors preceding lower
          specificity selectors. The following is the specificity hierarchy, from highest to lowest:

          Inline styles are styles that are applied to an element by using the style attribute in the HTML tag.
          ID selectors - Using the # character to select elements based on their unique ID.
          Class selectors - Using the. character to select elements based on their class.
          Type selectors are used to select elements based on their HTML tag names.
          Universal selectors - Using the * character to select all elements.</p>

        <h2>What is the difference between inline and internal CSS?</h2>
        <p>The key difference between inline and internal CSS is where the style rules are defined.
          Inline styles are defined directly within the HTML element, while internal styles are defined within the head
          section of the HTML document. Inline styles are applied only to the element where they are defined, while
          internal styles are applied to all elements that match the selector. Inline styles are often used for small,
          one-off style changes, while internal styles are used for larger, more complex styles.</p>

        <h2>What is a CSS sprite and how is it used in web design?</h2>
        <p>A CSS sprite is a technique used in web design to reduce the number of HTTP requests made by a web page by
          combining multiple images into a single larger image, and then using CSS to display only the portion of the
          image that is needed for a particular element on the page.
          The idea behind CSS sprites is that by reducing the number of HTTP requests needed to load a page, the page
          will load faster and be more responsive. This is because each HTTP request introduces some overhead in terms
          of latency and bandwidth, so reducing the number of requests reduces the total amount of overhead.
          To use a CSS sprite in web design, the designer creates a single larger image that includes all the smaller
          images needed for the page, and then uses CSS to display only the portion of the image that is needed for each
          element. This is done by setting the background-image property of the element to the URL of the larger image,
          and then using the background-position property to specify the portion of the image that should be displayed
          for that element.
          CSS sprites are often used for things like buttons, icons, and other small graphics that are used repeatedly
          on a web page. By combining these graphics into a single image and using CSS sprites, web designers can reduce
          the number of HTTP requests made by the page, which can help to improve page load times and overall
          performance.

        <h2>How do you create a responsive image with CSS?</h2>
        <p>To create a responsive image with CSS, you can use the max-width property on the image element, which will
          allow the image to scale down proportionally to fit within its container while maintaining its aspect ratio.
          Here is an example:
          <br>(img src="your-image-url.jpg" alt="Your image" style="max-width:100%;")
          <br>In this example, the max-width property is set to 100%, which means the image will never be wider than its
          container. As the container resizes, the image will adjust accordingly to maintain its aspect ratio.
          You can also use CSS media queries to adjust the image size and properties based on the device screen size.
          Here's an example of how to do this:
          /* For screens smaller than 768px */
          @media (max-width: 768px) {
          img {
          max-width: 100%;
          height: auto;
          }
          }

          /* For screens larger than 768px */
          @media (min-width: 769px) {
          img {
          max-width: 50%;
          height: auto;
          }
          }

          In this example, the image will have a max-width of 100% on screens smaller than 768px, and a max-width of 50%
          on screens larger than 768px. The height property is set to auto to maintain the image's aspect ratio.

        <h2>Can you explain the CSS float property and how it works?</h2>
        <p>The CSS float property is used to specify how an element should be positioned horizontally within its parent
          container. When an element is floated, it is taken out of the normal flow of the document and moved to the
          left or right side of its containing block.
          The float property can be set to left, right, or none. When an element is floated to the left or right, any
          text or other elements that come after it will flow around it, wrapping to the other side of the element.
          It's important to note that when an element is floated, it no longer takes up space in the same way as a
          non-floated element. This can sometimes cause layout issues, such as elements overlapping or not lining up as
          expected.
          To avoid these issues, it's important to use the clear property to specify whether an element should be
          positioned below any floated elements that come before it. The clear property can be set to left, right, both,
          or none.
          In general, the float property is commonly used for creating layouts where elements need to be positioned next
          to each other, such as for creating columns or placing images next to text.
          However, it's important to use the float property with caution and to be aware of its potential layout issues.
          Other CSS properties and techniques, such as flexbox and grid, may be better suited for creating more complex
          layouts.
