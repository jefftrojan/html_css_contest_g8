        <h3>ALU Software Engineering Department</h3>
        <img src="ru-campus.jpg" alt="ALU campus">
        <p>Department of Vawulence is a group of hilarious Software engineering students who love to joke around and
          share memes. We're always cracking jokes about programming languages, debugging, and even binary code. And
          don't get us started on our memes - we've got a whole library of them, and we're always on the lookout for the
          next big thing.

          Now, you might think that all this goofing around would get in the way of our studies, but you'd be wrong. We
          are some of the brightest students around *or not*, and we take our studies seriously(will edit this). We just
          happen to have a great sense of humor.</p>

        <h2>CSS specificity</h2>
        <p>CSS specificity is a measure of how specific a CSS selector is in targeting a specific element in an HTML
          document. When multiple styles are defined for the same element, it determines which styles should be applied
          to it.

          Selectors in CSS are ranked according to their specificity, with higher specificity selectors preceding lower
          specificity selectors. The following is the specificity hierarchy, from highest to lowest:

          Inline styles are styles that are applied to an element by using the style attribute in the HTML tag.
          ID selectors - Using the # character to select elements based on their unique ID.
          Class selectors - Using the. character to select elements based on their class.
          Type selectors are used to select elements based on their HTML tag names.
          Universal selectors - Using the * character to select all elements.</p>

        <h2>What is the difference between inline and internal CSS?</h2>
        <p>The key difference between inline and internal CSS is where the style rules are defined.
          Inline styles are defined directly within the HTML element, while internal styles are defined within the head
          section of the HTML document. Inline styles are applied only to the element where they are defined, while
          internal styles are applied to all elements that match the selector. Inline styles are often used for small,
          one-off style changes, while internal styles are used for larger, more complex styles.</p>

        <h2>What is a CSS sprite and how is it used in web design?</h2>
        <p>A CSS sprite is a technique used in web design to reduce the number of HTTP requests made by a web page by
          combining multiple images into a single larger image, and then using CSS to display only the portion of the
          image that is needed for a particular element on the page.
          The idea behind CSS sprites is that by reducing the number of HTTP requests needed to load a page, the page
          will load faster and be more responsive. This is because each HTTP request introduces some overhead in terms
          of latency and bandwidth, so reducing the number of requests reduces the total amount of overhead.
          To use a CSS sprite in web design, the designer creates a single larger image that includes all the smaller
          images needed for the page, and then uses CSS to display only the portion of the image that is needed for each
          element. This is done by setting the background-image property of the element to the URL of the larger image,
          and then using the background-position property to specify the portion of the image that should be displayed
          for that element.
          CSS sprites are often used for things like buttons, icons, and other small graphics that are used repeatedly
          on a web page. By combining these graphics into a single image and using CSS sprites, web designers can reduce
          the number of HTTP requests made by the page, which can help to improve page load times and overall
          performance.
